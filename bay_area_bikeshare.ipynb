    "Per the assignment 4 instructions, I have refined my definitions of morning and afternoon trips to encompass 7:00 – 9:00 and 16:00 – 19:00, respectively.\n",

    "The overall quantity of morning trips, represented by those with start times between 7:00 and 8:59, was 199,995. The overall quantity of afternoon trips, represented by those start times between 16:00 and 18:59, was 299,626.\n",
    "\n",
    "I refined this further by checking the quantity of trips in each of these categories with durations of under 30 minutes. 197,646 of the 199,995 morning trips and 289,743 of the 299,626 afternoon trips fell into this category. This demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of trips within the hours selected could be considered commuter trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I examined the breakdown of customer types for morning and afternoon trips. Subscribers accounted for 192,117 of the 199,995 morning trips and 266,764 of the 299,626 afternoon trips. It is clear that subscribers making commuter trips represented a large portion of the customer base in this dataset for trips made within commuting hours. The company running Bay Area Bikeshare would do well to reinforce and reward this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also studied the top five starting and ending points for morning and afternoon commuter trips. This analysis gave more actionable results. The frequencies of the most common start and end points ranged from 8,763 to 45,704, representing a much more substantial portion of the overall trip totals. The top five starting and ending points for morning and afternoon commuter trips is displayed in the morning_start, morning_end, afternoon_start, and afternoon_end tables above. The morning starting points and afternoon ending points are most telling. The top five locations in these two sets match.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this analysis, my recommendations to the company running Bay Area Bikeshare would be to offer discounted rates for new subscribers who begin morning trips or end afternoon trips of up to 30 minutes in duration at any of the top five locations described above: San Francisco Caltrain (Townsend at 4th), San Francisco Caltrain 2 (330 Townsend), Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry Building), Temporary Transbay Terminal (Howard at Beale), or Steuart at Market. The data do not give any indication of bike availability at these locations during peak times. I would recommend the company make certain to have sufficient stock at these locations during commuting hours, and plan to expand inventory to meet the new demand that will accompany the discounted rates."
